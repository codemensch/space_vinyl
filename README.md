Welcome to Space Vinyl

This Javascript web app is based off of SoundCloud's Widget API (https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget).

As of this writing, SoundCloud's developer API is currently unavailable and no new app registrations are being given. So the scope of this app is simply to play NASA sound playlists in a "vinyl format".

Eventually a playlist import feature would be a next step so any SoundCloud playlist could be played. Also, displaying track information somewhere in the UI using the API's get functions. Enjoy!

**Maintenance to be done**
-Re-factoring of css and javascript where possible.
-Fix choppy fadeIn() happening in Firefox and Safari.
-Fix choppy fade out happening on alert confirm.
-Object orientation of "albums" for future album information feature.
